# Grammy Award Analysis

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the Grammy award data to understand the trends and patterns in the award distribution among young and old artists. The objective is to determine if the claim that judges are inclined to give the Grammy to old artists is true or false.

## Data Preparation

1. Load the dataset "AustinCityLimit.csv" into R.
2. Clean the data by removing missing or irrelevant values.
3. Create new variables for age and award categories.

## Descriptive Statistics

1. Calculate the average age of all artists.
2. Calculate the average age of artists who have won a Grammy award.
3. Create a bar plot to visualize the distribution of Grammy awards among different age groups.
4. Conduct a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the average age of artists who have won a Grammy award and those who have not.

## Conclusion

Based on the results of the analysis, we will either accept or refute the claim that judges are inclined to give the Grammy to old artists. We will present the findings and provide recommendations for future research.
